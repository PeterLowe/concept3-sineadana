Title:
Techno Catch

Elavator Pitch:
Multiple level game where the player moves the character at the bottom of the screen
to catch falling down items from the top of the screen. The falling down items are 
different parts of technology, which will then create the technology at the end of the 
level. ie, Computer, the player keeps catching as many computer parts falling down 
from the sky to create a computer at the end of the level. The level ends when the
bar (representing total items caught) in the corner of the screen, fills up to 100%.
Each level has different technologies to be build, ie, computer, laptop, phone, 
TV, monitor, etc.
The players apperance will be a stereotypical nerd looking guy, with big glasses, braces,
funky shirt, and greasy hair.
